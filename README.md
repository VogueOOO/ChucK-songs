These are ChucK songs from after I finished Coursera 2013 ChucK course 

- initialize.ck is the final exam. It relies on the drums installed from the course.
- initialize_bp.ck is the bagpipe song. The concept is four hands playing one bagpipe.
- initialize_dim.ck is my alternate music for the last few minute of 2001 A Space Odyssey
- initialize_zoot.ck is the Schlockness Munster.wav

All of the songs have random melodies so the .wav files are included as my choice for each out of five trials.
