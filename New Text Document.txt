There's many ways to do this, some ways will be more convenient depending on the scenario. I find multi-dimensional arrays are a great way to do this.

[30,40,50,60] @=> int A[];  
[25,35,45,55] @=> int B[];  
  
// multidimensional array  
[A, B] @=> int M[][];  
  
for(int i; i<20; i++){  
  
    // first or second array, choice  
    Math.random2(0,1) => int selectionAB;  
  
    // then from A or B pick an element  
    Math.random2(0,3) => int index;  
  
    <<< M[selectionAB][index] >>>;  
}
